## Resources

For most analyzers/responders, the aim should be to merge into the official repo for use by others upon relative code maturity. Therefore, directory structure for analyzers and responders is organized similarly to the official [Cortex-Analyzers repo](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers).

Other code may be organized topically within subfolders of this directory (e.g. webhooks, &c.).
